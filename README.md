The prediction of stock market has come a long way from the basic fundamental analysis techniques to the complex machine learning algorithms mostly used nowadays to forecast stock market. This project uses a different approach to try and predict stock prices. Remarkable statistical methods used in Astronomy for analyzing X-ray spectrum, are used to analyze the variability of stock market. To be exact, Discrete Correlation Function (DCF) and Power Spectrum Density (PSD). Investigation of Power Spectrum led to the conclusion that stock prices move according to Brownian motion, so the path followed by the stock can be described by random walk, from which follows that it’s impossible to forecast stock prices using this method. Analyzing DCF showed that it’s sometimes possible to predict the trend that stock prices will follow in the future and in the case of supplier companies, if most of the profit is made out of the supplied company, correlation between these companies will be stronger and vice versa. Implying, that DCF technique can be potentially used by investors for higher returns.
